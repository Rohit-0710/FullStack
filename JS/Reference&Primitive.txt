Objects and Arrays are referenced type
So const person =
{
name: 'Max'
};

const secondPerson = person;
person.name ='Manu'
 It will Print Manu even though we have called it later because it is not copying the value it is referencing to it's address.


Now to copy it's value we use 
 
const secondPerson = {
...person
};
person.name = 'Manu';
It will now print Max
